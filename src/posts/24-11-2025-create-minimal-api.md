Minimal APIs are architected to create HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. They're ideal for microservices and apps that want to include only the minimum files, features, and dependencies in ASP.NET Core.

This tutorial teaches the basics of building a minimal API with ASP.NET Core. Another approach to creating APIs in ASP.NET Core is to use controllers.

Similar to this task is another related task, but a little more code is required that is, [Create a web API with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-10.0&tabs=visual-studio)

Awesome!
